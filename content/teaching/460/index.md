**EC 460**: Theories of Industrial Organization

* Summer 2019

* {{% staticref "files/460_syllabus.pdf" "newtab" %}}Syllabus{{% /staticref %}} 

Industrial organization is the study of the behaviors of firms and consumers in individual markets. This course covers the theory of industrial organization and includes quantitative measures and institutional descriptions of American and global industry. The course emphasizes the determinants and consequences of market power.

Student comments:

* "Overall, the structure and format of this course was excellent. Each chapter was covered in-depth using varying mathematical and graphical models without losing a sense of the overall themes of industrial organization. The style of alternating lecture with interactive math and graph examples helped break the monotony found in a usual lecture formatted class while solidifying the concepts just taught."
* "Brett's priority is that every student has a solid understanding of the material and will go out of his way to make that happen. There doesn't seem to be any students in the class that are struggling to keep up with the material and that is amazingly impressive given that we are on an intensive 4 week schedule."
* "Brett taught in a clear and thoughtful manner that was easy to follow. He always answered any lingering questions with thouroughness and sought to make each student feel included within the classroom setting. Regardless of prior economic knowledge, Brett encouraged students to express their ideas to various questions thereby creating an interactive in-class dialogue, which created a more dynamic classroom experience."
