**EC 360**: Issues in Industrial Organization

* Spring 2019, Winter 2020, Spring 2020 (online), Fall 2020 (online)

* {{% staticref "files/360_syllabus.pdf" "newtab" %}}Syllabus

* [Lecture slides](https://github.com/brettgabriel89/360/)

This course is designed to provide you with an introduction to industrial organization and its role in antitrust law. The relationship between industry structure and overall performance is examined, as well as the idea of what is desirable in market outcomes and how to improve flawed market outcomes. The first half of the class focuses on basic monopoly and antitrust, while the second half discusses more complex market structures. Throughout the course, we will tie theory to real, relevant court cases in the United States. The class will be approximately equal parts math, graphing, discussing laws, and discussing court cases.

Student comments:

* "I learned the most from this economics course than other economics courses at UO. Brett really knows what he's talking about and is always there to help his students."
* "Brett taught excellent throughout the term, enabling me to learn at my full potential compared to other previous economic classes that I have taken. He was extremely accommodating and inclusive for all students, taking the necessary time in and out of the classroom to make sure that everybody has the equal opportunity to understand the material to the best of their ability. I felt as if a different professor in this course would not have yielded the same amount of learning and progression that I have as a student of Brett’s during this course."
* "I typically have always struggled in my economics classes and found it very intimidating asking questions fearing the teacher would find the question stupid. Very rarely do professors create an environment that makes it easy for me to feel like I could ask them any question, yet Brett was one of the few who did exactly that. Brett created this environment by showing a degree of patience that most professors lack. By creating this environment, I felt motivated to reach out for clarification on material since I knew Brett was able to clearly and patiently explain concepts in a way that didn’t belittle me."
* "I find the material very interesting and he does an excellent job of making his lectures have a good pace and interesting topics."
* "Thank you for everything you did for me this term. You taught an amazing class completely remote! I find industrial organization very interesting and will definitely try and take the 400 level version of this class in the future."
