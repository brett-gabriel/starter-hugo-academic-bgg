Student comments:

* "I think that Brett did an amazing job leading the discussion over this term. He was very specific and to the point when teaching and he was always very thorough in answering the questions asked in class."

* "Brett should be teaching this class, this guy is incredible at teaching and is very engaging. The economics department should offer him a job teaching as soon as possible."

* "Very helpful. He made me understand the material way better than if I were to do it myself. He hit the key parts of lecture in the discussion which helped me out a lot in understanding concepts for the class."

* "He was great at explaining our questions in depth. I left class always understanding something I didn't know before."

* "The instructor was very helpful and maximized discussion time very well. He explained things well and was willing to work with students when they did not understand something."
