**EC 340**: Issues in Public Economics

* Summer 2018

* {{% staticref "files/340_syllabus.pdf" "newtab" %}}Syllabus{{% /staticref %}} 

In this course we develop and apply several tools to analyze public policy. Efficiency is a key concept and we study it in a variety of conditions: competitive markets, public goods, externalities, taxes, corruption, and more. By the end of the quarter you will be able to think critically about public issues from an economic perspective and improve your ability to analyze policy.
