**EC 202**: Introduction to Macroeconomics

* Winter 2017, Winter 2019

This course examines the aggregate activity of a market economy, the problems that arise, such as inflation and unemployment, and how the government can use macroeconomic policy to address these problems.

Student comments:

* "Brett was a fantastic instructor! He explained the information clearly and was very engaging with the class. I learned a lot in his discussion and would always leave with a better understanding of the topic."

* "Brett did an excellent job at explaining the curriculum we were learning. He provided lots of examples, and went slowly and clearly articulated the material. Brett did a great job at helping me better understand the curriculum. He was very effective in office hours and always responded to emails."

* "I really liked Brett as my section leader. He was always open to questions and/or repeating himself, and always available for help outside of class."

* "Brett led a great discussion section that gave us a better and deeper understanding of the material taught in class. I found discussions to be super helpful."

* "Worked in a manner that all students understand, which was a great environment to learn in. Very smart and articulate. Really enjoyed this discussion."

* "The leader is very reliable and trustworthy. He is very instructive and knows what he is doing. No areas of possible improvement."

* "Brett lays things out in a very easy way to understand and follow. He was able to break some of the more complex concepts down into easily digestible parts which were then easier to work through. You can tell that he really wants you to understand and succeed and he is willing to work with each student individually to ensure their needs are met."

* "Brett was super helpful during discussion. He guided the class through concepts in a clear and concise manner. Overall, my understanding of the class was much clearer thanks to Brett."
