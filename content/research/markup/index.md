Regulators of the railroad industry are tasked with protecting shippers from excessive rates for shipments in which the railroad is market dominant, defined as an absence of effective competition from intramodal and intermodal competition. This task requires shipment costs at an extremely disaggregate level. The current regulatory accounting approach of allocating costs is heavily criticized and cost functions in the academic literature are generally highly aggregated. In this paper, I develop a method to measure costs and markups that retains their disaggregate properties. I then use these results to explore market dominance, wherein the markup and the presence of competition determine whether shippers may be eligible to contest the reasonableness of the rate. I find that a movement from rail monopoly to duopoly is associated with an average 6.8\% decline in rail markups. The results suggest nearby ports decrease the impact of rail competition on rail markups. This approach can be operationalized by regulators and market participants to assess the reasonableness of a rate and to streamline and expedite market dominance inquiry.
